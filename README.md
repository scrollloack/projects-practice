# Build

- Make projects for each of the listed learnings below
- Make sure they are detailed with explanations step by step.
- Make sure the projects are built with docker.
- The tech stack I would use are nodejs/typescript, postgresql and if you recommend the use of redis and others make sure to note them.
- Suggest if using NestJS makes sense.
- At the end after making mini projects for each, make a final project that combines all learnings in the list.
- Make it BDD style.
- You can put everything to each of their own MD/markdown file in your canvas.
